# WebSecService Security Considerations

## 10. Server Configuration

*   **HTTPS**: The application is configured to enforce HTTPS-only communication with automatic HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.
*   **SSL Certificate Management**: Server certificates are properly configured and managed.
*   **Client Certificate Authentication**: Optional SSL client certificate authentication provides an additional layer of security.
*   **File Permissions**: Web server file permissions should be configured securely to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
*   **.env File Security**: The `.env` file containing sensitive credentials should not be publicly accessible and excluded from version control.
